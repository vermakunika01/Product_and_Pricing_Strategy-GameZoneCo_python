# Product & Pricing Strategy - GameZone Co
GameZone Co. is an e-commerce gaming company. We are solving one key Business Problem Statement for the Executive team:  
**How can we improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts across marketing channels, products, and countries, based on customer behavior and transaction patterns?**

## Project Scope and Dataset Overview

### Dataset Highlights: 
- Data of purchase transactions from Gamezone.co
- Covers 2019–2021 (3-year window)
- Includes 20,000+ entries across:
    - Products purchased
    - Purchase & shipping dates
    - Platforms and marketing channels
    - Country of purchase
 
### Objective of this analysis: 
- This analysis is designed to equip teams develop a tailored plan that caters to audience’s evolving demands real-time. 
- It aims to support decision-making across:
  - The **executive** team: with high-level trends and growth opportunities
  - The **marketing** team: by identifying top-performing channels and timing
  - The **portfolio and pricing** teams: by uncovering product and country-level opportunities for targeted strategy

 
## Key Business Insights:
**_Insights and related recommendations for the way forward have been added to the uploaded summary file_**
- Fridays seem the **prime day of maximum customer activity**, suggesting marketing campaign and offer timelines to be planned accordingly
- Direct marketing drives top product revenue; **social media remains underleveraged**.
- Striking the **right balance between volume vs price value is important** – the current contrast between the variables gives key insights into pricing strategies
- Only 37% of the 150 countries have explored more than 4 products while the **portfolio remains under-explored in more than half of the countries**. This highlights the scope of expanding portfolio coverage

## Approach used for the analaysis: 
- Understanding and conceptualising the data
- Data Cleaning and Preparation (a log file was created for the same):
    - Evaluated the consistency of the dataset
    - Checked consistency in terms of business logic
    - Fixed missing values
- Identified the limitations/ assumptions to keep in mind
- Exploratory Analysis (Python: numpy and pandas)
- Visualization of Insights (Python: matplotlib, seaborn)
- Final Storylining for clear business impact

## Learnings from the Project: 
- Identifying the **grain of the dataset** is a crucial step before beginning any work on the project - it not only helps you clean the data well but also fine tunes the analysis approach.
- Before deep diving into the analysis, real work begins with:
  - translating the problem statement into **business impact, opportunities, and risks** (if the problem is not addressed)
  - identifying the **stakeholders** that could leverage the outcome of the analysis
  - understanding what each team considers a **'successful metric outcome'**
- **Time series analysis** of this data could help us solve problems like declining sales, changes in customer behaviours over time, etc. However, since the given problem required root-cause analysis of the current state, analysis of the overall data has been done.
- **Root-Cause Analysis**: Answering the "So What" for each insight is important to make it a meaninful actionable for the senior leaders of a company.
